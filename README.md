CrypticUI

CrypticUI is a graphical user interface (GUI) application developed in Python using the Tkinter library. It offers functionalities for text encryption, decryption, and image encoding/decoding, providing a user-friendly interface for cryptographic operations.

Features
1. Text Encryption and Decryption: Easily encrypt and decrypt text using a generated or user-provided encryption key.
2. Image Encoding and Decoding: Encode text into images and decode hidden text from images.
3. Random Encryption Key Generation: Quickly generate a random encryption key for use in encryption operations.

Dependencies:
1. To use the application first one has to install Python in their system.
2. After installing Python few packages have to be installed using the terminal which are listed below:
a. Cryptography-pip install Cryptography
b. Tkinter- pip install Tkinter
c. Pillow - pip install Pillow
d. Pyperclip - pip install pyperclip

Use the GUI to perform the following operations:

1. Generate a random encryption key.
2. Encrypt and decrypt text.
3. Encode text into images and decode text from images.
4. Copy encrypted/decrypted text to the clipboard.
5. Download encoded images.
